    Parameters
    ----------
    time_series_dictionary: dict
        The time series dictionary structured as follow:
            - The first keys levels is the different groupes.
            - The second keys levels is the subjects IDs
            - The third levels is two keys : 'time_series' containing the

    -------
    output: dict
        The same time series dictionary with a field called 'masked_array' for

        rois, True for a discarded rois, and False elsewhere.

    Notes
    -----
    If 'discarded_rois' is empty the mask is False at every position
    in the array.
    Almost all the operation in ConPagnon accounts for discarded rois with
    masked array via the dedicated module in NumPy.

    output : dict
        A multi-levels dictionnary organised as follow :
            - The first keys levels is the different groupes in the study. 
            - The second keys levels is the subjects IDs
            - The third levels contain multiple keys : multiple
            kind keys containing the corresponding kind matrix.
            a 'discarded_rois' key containing the index of discarded
            rois.
            Finally you should find a 'masked_array' key : This key 
            contains a array of Boolean, shape (numbers of regions, numbers of regions)
            where the value are True for the index in 'discarded_rois' array, and False
            elsewhere. See Note for further details. The diagonal of the
            matrix are saved for each kind too in a dedicated field.
            
    See Also
    --------
    time_series_extraction, time_series_extraction_with_individual_atlases :
        These are the functions which extract the time series according atlas
        regions and returned a structured dictionnary. 
        This is simply the argument `time_series_dictionary`.
        
    Notes 
    -----
    Covariances estimator are estimators compute in the scikit-learn library.
    Multiple estimator can be found in the module sklearn.covariance, popular
    choices are the Ledoit-Wolf estimator, or the OAS estimator.
    
    In the output dictionnary, each subjects have a masked array of boolean. The
    masked will be useful when computing the mean connectivity matrices, we will
    account the discarded rois in the derivation. For the statistical test you might
    want perform, it will be useful too, to discarded those rois. A True value is
    a masked roi, False elsewhere.
    
    For the tangent kind, the derivation of individual matrices need to be
    made on the POOLED GROUPS which is performed here. 
    
    The derivation of connectivity matrices are based on Nilearn functions. I
    encourage the user to read the following docstring of important functions :

    Be careful with the interpretation !!

        The correction method used for to correct for
